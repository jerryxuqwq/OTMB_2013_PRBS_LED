   "Top" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc6vlx240t, package ff1156, speed -2

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to 1.050 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.17 2013-10-13".



INFO:Par:402 - SmartGuide was run during Map. Since all guiding (mapping, packing, placement and routing) is completed in MAP, PAR does not
   require the use of the guide switches. The -smartguide switch only generates a post place and route guide report in the SmartGuide Report
   File(.GRF). Runtime can be reduced, if this detailed report is not generated. PAR will automatically generate the SmartGuide summary
   report based on the guide file used during MAP. This summary information is always in the PAR report file and the GRF.

  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          131

      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 301,440    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
