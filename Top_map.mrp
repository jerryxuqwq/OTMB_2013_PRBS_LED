  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Pack:2609 - SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime)
   when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of
   the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then
   re-create your guide file.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net _n0190 is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:56 - Part 'xc6vlx240t' is not a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network _ccb_rx<50> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 43 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   _ccb_rx<49>,
   _ccb_rx<48>,
   _ccb_rx<47>,
   _ccb_rx<46>,
   _ccb_rx<45>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:980 - The following NGM file is used during SmartGuide:
   "/home/cscdev/JerryX/OTMB/OTMB_2013_PRBS_LED/Top_map.ngm". The NGM file
   contains information on how the guide file was originally mapped. It is
   required for the best SmartGuide results.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   1 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "q1_clk1_refclk_bufg_i" (CKBUF) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.

Section 8 - Guide Report

  Estimated SmartGuide Results
  ----------------------------
  This section describes the guide results after placement. Re-implemented 
  components are components that were guided, but moved in order to satisfy
  timing requirements.

    Estimated Percentage of guided Components                 |  80.6%
    Estimated Percentage of re-implemented Components         |   0.0%
    Estimated Percentage of new/changed Components            |  19.4%
    Estimated Percentage of fully guided Nets                 |  67.0%
    Estimated Percentage of partially guided or unrouted Nets |  33.0%

  A detailed SmartGuide report (.GRF) can be generated during PAR by
  specifying the [-smartguide <guidefile[.ncd]>] switch on the PAR
  command line. The GRF file contains all components and nets that were
  not guided. A final summary report is always generated and is available
  in the PAR report file and in the GRF regardless of the PAR -smartguide switch.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
