WARNING:Pack:2609 - SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime)
   when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of
   the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then
   re-create your guide file.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
